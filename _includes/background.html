      Welcome to my corner of the web. I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://youview.com/" target="_blank">YouView</a>, where I lead our data insights, experimentation and business intelligence team. 
      I have a degree in data science, with a focus on urban informatics, from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a> and a background in philosophy and experimental psychology, which I read at the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>.      
    </p>

      Data is now everywhere&mdash;wittingly or unwittingly for us old humans&mdash;and I'm interested in leveraging this ubiquity of data to design products and systems that enhance people's lives.<br><br>

      How do people move in a city? How do we amplify voices equitably in organizations? What is the future of learning? How can customer interactions help design products that people love?
      These are some of the questions I seek to answer&mdash;one dataset at a time.
