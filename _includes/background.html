      Welcome to my corner of the web. 

      Data is everywhere, whether we like it or not––and I'm interested in using data to design better lives, systems and products for us old humans.

      How do people move in a city? How do we amplify voices equitable in organizations? What does ed tech mean for the future of learning? How do we use customer interactions to design products that people love?
      These are some of the questions I have sought to answer--one dataset at a time.
